# Moving Feature file format:

#
# KNOWN LIMITATION:
# The CRS declared on the first header line should be "urn:ogc:def:crs:TB18-D025::VoyagerCRS",
# but Apache SIS does not yet have a mechanism for referring to definitions using the identifiers
# found in the GML file. For now we cheat by specifying EPSG::4979.
#
# This file contains random values. There is no realistic transformation here.
